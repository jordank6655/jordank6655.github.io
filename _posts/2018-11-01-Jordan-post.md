This week in class we learned all about tables.Now I have  a better understanding  of name , domain , and range. The name of a contract is at the front. Then comes the domain which is in parentheses. At the end is the range. Name,Domain, and Range all make up a contract. I also learned that numbers represent either measurement or counting that's it. I learned that most data from sport records and news are  Just coded charts.
