Im choosing to reflect  on question 1 of version 2 in this question it's asking about the innermost function of string-length("broccoli") + 8 
the answer was string-length. My first answer for the question was the string "broccoli".I thought this because I figured  innermost meant that I had to look in the middle  of the contract to find the innermost function.Once I got the answer I realized the  innermost function was at the beginning of the contract.
