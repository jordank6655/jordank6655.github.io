At the beggining of the week we made flags out of paper to get a sense of how to make the flags on the computer.I thought the point was to show your understanding of the pattern and size showing how wide and tall something should be in order for it to work. I still need to know how to overlap images in order to make the flag look like a flag.I know how to make different colors and sizes for the shapes.
